###  Why I joined the [HNG](https://internship.zuri.team) internship and the goals I want to achieve by the end of the internship

My name is Aaron Kehinde Adetunmbi, and I'm a full-stack developer, I have been coding for a while now, but to be honest I have always felt something to be missing.

## I have seen a lot of tutorials:

like a lot, especially on webdev, also some on [UI/UX design](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjV_Oe_7rLyAhUKxoUKHcMZBlIQwqsBegQIBhAB&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk1T0CdLxwU&usg=AOvVaw18hN3JK2ybN3j5javPK6eE) (when I started, I tried to learn UI/UX  design) and others.
It got to a point, I realized, I needed to concentrate/focus; have an area of specialization, so I decided to go into web development and only that. So I started watching videos on [different aspects of webdev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_web_design_and_web_development). For version control, I watched a tutorial on [Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjQznt-8kE), also for HTML 5 and CSS, I watched [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ivBf_eKCPIAYXWzLlPAm6G) and for javascript, I used a lot because some concepts were hard to understand so I watched a lot of videos, but is I had to choose it would be this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-essentials/?LSNPUBID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranMID=39197&ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-ZvTNX7lgHIqYAfjFJXZI4A&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_source=aff-campaign).

## But you know what:
Being a developer is more than watching videos and making calculators, that's when I discovered the HNG internship on [twitter](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwif1JWXo7PyAhWkQUEAHXM-DKsQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https://twitter.com/hnginternship/status/1382937218164097024&usg=AOvVaw1NyM0e0W364rYIHucjKGub), and I knew that was what I needed. To be honest, we also have something called Developer's Student's Club(DSC) in my school, I'm going to assume they are similar, but HNG being the remote own felt more interesting.

# # The goals I hope to have achieve after i'm done with it:

## 1. Networking with other developers:

I really don't have experience with working with other developers, I don't even think I have the contacts of up to 5 developers on my phone, I want this to change, I was in contact with a lot of developers before, those being the developers I started coding with, like 8 of them, but I can say not even 2 of them code anymore. shocker abiðŸ˜‚.

## 2.  I want to improve by working on projects with people:
One of the mistakes, I made when I started coding and watching tutorial, was that I watched more videos than I coded(which is what people mean when they say [tutorial hell](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/tutorial-hell-how-can-you-escape-it-8a6a7da3ae08?gi=12e5cb58d0ec)), that was one of the reasons I said in the top that "I felt something to be missing", I strongly believe that someone that has watched 2 videos and is applying what they learnt to create anything, is improving at a very fast rate compared to someone watching more videos, in fact from a personal experience , I can say the person watching more videos isn't improving at all.

## 3. Working with other developers and creating projects together:
Just like what i said in the previous paragraph, working on project is one of the many ways to improve as a developer, you know what is more better, working on projects with people, since I'm not in contact with many developers, this was proving difficult, until I learnt about HNG, with the HNG internship, I'm hoping to be able to work on projects, improve my skills and learn more about interacting with other developers.
 

**Thanks for persisting till the end:)..**
