##  Hi this is my first page on my blog

Since i started my programming journey, one thing i have always wanted to have was a blog, not that i had anything to sayðŸ˜‚, but i thought it would be fun to have, i also thought u needed money to have one! till i learnt more about github page.
My first intention  was to use a README page for blog
So when i first learnts about github page,i thought it was meant to be used for documentation
