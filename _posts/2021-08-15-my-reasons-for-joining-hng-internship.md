###  Why I joined the [HNG](https://internship.zuri.team) internship and the goals i want to achieve by the end of the internship

My name is Aaron Kehinde Adetunmbi, and I'm a full-stack developer, i have been coding for a while now, but to be honest i have always felt something to be missing.

## I have used/watch a lot of tutorials:

like a lot, especially on webdev, also some on [UI/UX design](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjV_Oe_7rLyAhUKxoUKHcMZBlIQwqsBegQIBhAB&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk1T0CdLxwU&usg=AOvVaw18hN3JK2ybN3j5javPK6eE) (when i started, i tried to learn UI/UX  design) and others.
It got to a point, i realized, i needed to concentrate/focus; have an area of specialization, so i decided to go into web development and only that. So I started watching videos on [different aspects of webdev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_web_design_and_web_development). For version control, i watched a tutorial on [Git](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RjQznt-8kE), also for HTML 5 and CSS, i  watched [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ivBf_eKCPIAYXWzLlPAm6G) and for javascript, I used a lot because some concepts were hard to understand so I watched a lot of videos, but is I had to choose it would be this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-essentials/?LSNPUBID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranEAID=JVFxdTr9V80&ranMID=39197&ranSiteID=JVFxdTr9V80-ZvTNX7lgHIqYAfjFJXZI4A&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_source=aff-campaign).

## But you know what:
Being a developer is more than watching videos and making calculators, that's when i discovered the HNG internship on [twitter](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwif1JWXo7PyAhWkQUEAHXM-DKsQFnoECAMQAQ&url=https://twitter.com/hnginternship/status/1382937218164097024&usg=AOvVaw1NyM0e0W364rYIHucjKGub), and i knew that was what i needed. To be honest, we also have something called Developer's Student's Club(DSC) in my school, I'm going to assume they are similar, but HNG being the remote own felt more interesting.

# My reasons for joining the hng internship:

## 1. Networking with other developers:

I really don't have experience with working with other developers, i don't even think i have the contacts of up to 5 developers on my phone, i want this to change, i was in contact with a lot of developers before, that was the developers i started coding with, like 8 of them, but i can say not even 2 of them code anymore. shocker abiðŸ˜‚.

## 2. I wasn't improving at all:
One of the mistakes, i made when i started coding and watching tutorial, was that i watched more videos than i coded(which is what people mean when they say tutorial hell), that was one of the reasons i said in the top that "i felt something to be missing", while in reality someone that has watched 2 videos and is applying what they learnt to create anything, is improving at a very fast rate compared to someone watching more video, in fact from a personal experience the person watching more video isn't improving at all.

## 3. Working with other developers and creating projects together:
Just like what i said in the previous paragraph, working on project is one of the many ways to improve as a developer, you know what is more better, working on projects with people, since I'm not in contact with many developers, this was proving difficult, unless i learnt about hng, with the hng internship, I'm hoping to be able to working on projects with my existing knowledge and new colleagues.
 

**Thanks for persisting till the end:)..**
