##  Hi this is my first page on my blog

Since i started my programming journey, one thing i have always wanted to have was a blog, not that i had anything to sayðŸ˜‚, but i thought it would be fun to have, i also thought u needed money to have one! till i learnt more about [github page.](https://dfederm.com/creating-a-blog-using-github-pages/)
My first intention  was to use a README page for blogging, but its obvious it won't scale, so i decided to use google and check around to see the option broke people like me have lool. Then i came across a blog post which talked about [different alternatives](https://stackshare.io/github-pages/alternatives) i can use for my blogging and finally i decided to use github page  .
So when i first learnt about github page,i thought it was meant to be used  only for documentation and but so far so good, i have a bit of problem with the bot bossing me around but i know it is for my own good, so i will put up with it for now.
Thanks for reading my blog tbh this wasn't really that much of a post, it was made all in the quest in learning more about github page.
